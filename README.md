# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization. In this project:

I used Express to create a CRUD API
Integrated Prettier
Created an entry point
Set up hot reload using mongoose
Created a database with MongoDB and connected my API to the database
Created models, routes, and controllers
Error handling implemented
Tested the project with Postman and GitHub Actions
